1. Select the first UDP segment in your trace. What is the packet number  of this 4
segment in the trace file?  What type of application-layer payload or protocol 
message is being carried in this UDP segment?  Look at the details of this packet 
in Wireshark.  How many fields there are in the UDP header? (You shouldn’t look 
in the textbook! Answer these questions directly from what you observe in the 
packet trace.) What are the names of these fields?

5, SSDP, 8 headers, host cache nts location server nt usn 

2. By consulting the displayed information in Wireshark’s packet content field for 
this packet (or by consulting the textbook), what is the length (in bytes) of each of 
the UDP header fields? 

2 bytes long

3. The value in the Length field is the length of what? (You can consult the text for 
this answer). Verify your claim with your captured UDP packet. 


4. What is the maximum number of bytes that can be included in a UDP payload?  
(Hint: the answer to this question can be determined by your answer to 2. above) 
5. What is the largest possible source port number? (Hint: see the hint in 4.) 


6. What is the protocol number for UDP? Give your answer in decimal notation. To 
answer this question, you’ll need to look into the Protocol field of the IP datagram 
containing this UDP segment (see Figure 4.13 in the text, and the discussion of IP 
header fields).  


7. Examine the pair of UDP packets in which your host sends the first UDP packet 
and the second UDP packet is a reply to this first UDP packet. (Hint: for a second 
packet to be sent in response to a first packet, the sender of the first packet should 
be the destination of the second packet).  What is the packet number  of the first 5
of these two UDP segments in the trace file?  What is the packet number  of the 6
second of these two UDP segments in the trace file? Describe the relationship 
between the port numbers in the two packets.
